Is it *so* bad to love alone?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With two arms —  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not four.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one beating heart -  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not two.  


Wrapping my two arms around myself —  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clutching a pillow at night —  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shivering in the cold.  


Is it *so* bad to love alone?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When in the morning —  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll have but two memories —  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an old one with you —  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a new one without.  


Both with equal primacy.  
Both as real in the primordial madness of the universe.  
Both alive in my mind —  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until my mind is no longer alive —  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and love no longer has any meaning at all.
