title = "Using Hugo to Build This Site"

+++

When I began building this site I knew I wanted to use a static site generator.  First, because I could think of no reason why a database should
have to be involved in building a personal site, but second, and more important by far, static site generators are hip and trendy, which I  appreciated greatly (a fault I have no problem admitting, we are who we are).

I chose Hugo over Jekyll because I'm an internet moron and I'm impressed by benchmarks.  I was also interested in working with something written in
the Go Programming language.  Hugo is mature software, though, so it was never necessary for me to write a line of Go.  I have heard Go is C-Like, so I'm sure I'd love it.  Maybe in the future I'll get to see some Go code in person. I do believe, though, that Hugo uses Go's templating language by default, which I have enjoyed working with.

Hugo is a simple binary, and installation is covered on [Hugo's Website](https://gohugo.io/).
